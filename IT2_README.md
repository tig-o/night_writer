#Iteration 2: Writing Braille

Each line of your Braille file should be no wider than 40 Braille characters (80 dots) wide.

In order to break this problem down further, you may wish to work on things in the following order:

- [x] Update your existing Ruby program to take the entire message contained in your input file and save it to the output file provided by a user. At this point, do not do any work to translate the message to Braille.
- [x] Create a dictionary of some sort that allows you to look up a English letter and find its Braille equivalent.
- [] Update your program to take an input file with a single letter and create an output file with the Braille equivalent.
- [] Update your program again so that it can take multiple letters. Compare results with a classmate.
- [] Update the program so that messages of more than 80 characters are split over multiple lines.
